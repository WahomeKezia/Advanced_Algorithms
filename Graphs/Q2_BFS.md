****1. Required descriptions
****
- How many nodes n?
- How many edges m?
- How many adjacent edges e?

****Tasks to be completed****

Complete the bfs function, If a node is unreachable, its distance is -1.

bfs has the following parameter(s):

int n: the number of nodes
int m: the number of edges
int e[]: start and end nodes for edges
int s: the node to start traversals from
Consider the weight (w) of every edge to be 4.

Returns
int d[ ]: the distances to nodes in increasing distance number order, ensure the negative values at the end of the array

The file 

Returns: [-1, -1, 0, 4, 4, 8, 12]
