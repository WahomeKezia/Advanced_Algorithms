##Question one 
---
For the graph below use Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm to find a minimum weight spanning
tree. Your answer should include a complete list of the edges, indicating which edges you take for \
your tree in the course of running the algorithm.

Tasks to be done

1. Use Kruskal's algorithm and write a program that will return the minimum spanning tree of the graph given (the graph contains all edges of the parent graph).
2. Draw the graph from the resulting values returned from task 1.

3. Use prim's algorithm and write a program that will return the minimum spanning tree of the graph given (the graph contains all edges of the parent graph)
4. Draw the graph and from the resulting values returned from task 3

5. Justify whether or not the two graphs are the same.
6. Justify which algorithm is better and why?
